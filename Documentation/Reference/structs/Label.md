**STRUCT**

# `Label`

The `GtkLabel` widget displays a small amount of text.

As the name implies, most labels are used to label another widget
such as a [class@Button].

![An example GtkLabel](label.png)

# CSS nodes

```
label
├── [selection]
├── [link]
┊
╰── [link]
```

`GtkLabel` has a single CSS node with the name label. A wide variety
of style classes may be applied to labels, such as .title, .subtitle,
.dim-label, etc. In the `GtkShortcutsWindow`, labels are used with the
.keycap style class.

If the label has a selection, it gets a subnode with name selection.

If the label has links, there is one subnode per link. These subnodes
carry the link or visited state depending on whether they have been
visited. In this case, label node also gets a .link style class.

# GtkLabel as GtkBuildable

The GtkLabel implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
“start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify [struct@Pango.Attribute]
values for this label.

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:
```xml
<object class="GtkLabel"><attributes><attribute name="weight" value="PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD"/><attribute name="background" value="red" start="5" end="10"/></attributes></object>
```

The start and end attributes specify the range of characters to which the
Pango attribute applies. If start and end are not specified, the attribute is
applied to the whole text. Note that specifying ranges does not make much
sense with translatable attributes. Use markup embedded in the translatable
content instead.

# Accessibility

`GtkLabel` uses the %GTK_ACCESSIBLE_ROLE_LABEL role.

# Mnemonics

Labels may contain “mnemonics”. Mnemonics are underlined characters in the
label, used for keyboard navigation. Mnemonics are created by providing a
string with an underscore before the mnemonic character, such as `"_File"`,
to the functions [ctor@Gtk.Label.new_with_mnemonic] or
[method@Gtk.Label.set_text_with_mnemonic].

Mnemonics automatically activate any activatable widget the label is
inside, such as a [class@Gtk.Button]; if the label is not inside the
mnemonic’s target widget, you have to tell the label about the target
using [method@Gtk.Label.set_mnemonic_widget].

Here’s a simple example where the label is inside a button:

```c
// Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new ();
GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
gtk_button_set_child (GTK_BUTTON (button), label);
```

There’s a convenience function to create buttons with a mnemonic label
already inside:

```c
// Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
```

To create a mnemonic for a widget alongside the label, such as a
[class@Gtk.Entry], you have to point the label at the entry with
[method@Gtk.Label.set_mnemonic_widget]:

```c
// Pressing Alt+H will focus the entry
GtkWidget *entry = gtk_entry_new ();
GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget (GTK_LABEL (label), entry);
```

# Markup (styled text)

To make it easy to format text in a label (changing colors,
fonts, etc.), label text can be provided in a simple
markup format:

Here’s how to create a label with a small font:
```c
GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), "<small>Small text</small>");
```

(See the Pango manual for complete documentation] of available
tags, [func@Pango.parse_markup])

The markup passed to [method@Gtk.Label.set_markup] must be valid; for example,
literal `<`, `>` and `&` characters must be escaped as `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;`.
If you pass text obtained from the user, file, or a network to
[method@Gtk.Label.set_markup], you’ll want to escape it with
[func@GLib.markup_escape_text] or [func@GLib.markup_printf_escaped].

Markup strings are just a convenient way to set the [struct@Pango.AttrList]
on a label; [method@Gtk.Label.set_attributes] may be a simpler way to set
attributes in some cases. Be careful though; [struct@Pango.AttrList] tends
to cause internationalization problems, unless you’re applying attributes
to the entire string (i.e. unless you set the range of each attribute
to [0, %G_MAXINT)). The reason is that specifying the start_index and
end_index for a [struct@Pango.Attribute] requires knowledge of the exact
string being displayed, so translations will cause problems.

# Selectable labels

Labels can be made selectable with [method@Gtk.Label.set_selectable].
Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to
the clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information
— such as error messages — should be made selectable.

# Text layout

A label can contain any number of paragraphs, but will have
performance problems if it contains more than a small number.
Paragraphs are separated by newlines or other paragraph separators
understood by Pango.

Labels can automatically wrap text if you call [method@Gtk.Label.set_wrap].

[method@Gtk.Label.set_justify] sets how the lines in a label align
with one another. If you want to set how the label as a whole aligns
in its available space, see the [property@Gtk.Widget:halign] and
[property@Gtk.Widget:valign] properties.

The [property@Gtk.Label:width-chars] and [property@Gtk.Label:max-width-chars]
properties can be used to control the size allocation of ellipsized or
wrapped labels. For ellipsizing labels, if either is specified (and less
than the actual text size), it is used as the minimum width, and the actual
text size is used as the natural width of the label. For wrapping labels,
width-chars is used as the minimum width, if specified, and max-width-chars
is used as the natural width. Even if max-width-chars specified, wrapping
labels will be rewrapped to use all of the available width.

# Links

GTK supports markup for clickable hyperlinks in addition to regular Pango
markup. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML, using the `<a>` with
“href“, “title“ and “class“ attributes. GTK renders links similar to the
way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined text. The “title“
attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link. The “class“ attribute is
used as style class on the CSS node for the link.

An example looks like this:

```c
const char *text =
"Go to the "
"<a href=\"https://www.gtk.org\" title=\"&lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; website\">"
"GTK website</a> for more...";
GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), text);
```

It is possible to implement custom handling for links and their tooltips
with the [signal@Gtk.Label::activate-link] signal and the
[method@Gtk.Label.get_current_uri] function.

## Properties
### `updateFunctions`

Additional update functions for type extensions.

### `appearFunctions`

Additional appear functions for type extensions.

### `accessibleRole`

The accessible role of the given `GtkAccessible` implementation.

The accessible role cannot be changed once set.

### `label`

The contents of the label.

If the string contains Pango markup (see [func@Pango.parse_markup]),
you will have to set the [property@Gtk.Label:use-markup] property to
%TRUE in order for the label to display the markup attributes. See also
[method@Gtk.Label.set_markup] for a convenience function that sets both
this property and the [property@Gtk.Label:use-markup] property at the
same time.

If the string contains underlines acting as mnemonics, you will have to
set the [property@Gtk.Label:use-underline] property to %TRUE in order
for the label to display them.

### `lines`

The number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping label
should be limited.

This property has no effect if the label is not wrapping or ellipsized.
Set this property to -1 if you don't want to limit the number of lines.

### `maxWidthChars`

The desired maximum width of the label, in characters.

If this property is set to -1, the width will be calculated automatically.

See the section on [text layout](class.Label.html#text-layout) for details of how
[property@Gtk.Label:width-chars] and [property@Gtk.Label:max-width-chars]
determine the width of ellipsized and wrapped labels.

### `mnemonicKeyval`

The mnemonic accelerator key for the label.

### `mnemonicWidget`

The widget to be activated when the labels mnemonic key is pressed.

### `selectable`

Whether the label text can be selected with the mouse.

### `singleLineMode`

Whether the label is in single line mode.

In single line mode, the height of the label does not depend on the
actual text, it is always set to ascent + descent of the font. This
can be an advantage in situations where resizing the label because
of text changes would be distracting, e.g. in a statusbar.

### `useMarkup`

%TRUE if the text of the label includes Pango markup.

See [func@Pango.parse_markup].

### `useUnderline`

%TRUE if the text of the label indicates a mnemonic with an _
before the mnemonic character.

### `widthChars`

The desired width of the label, in characters.

If this property is set to -1, the width will be calculated automatically.

See the section on [text layout](class.Label.html#text-layout) for details of how
[property@Gtk.Label:width-chars] and [property@Gtk.Label:max-width-chars]
determine the width of ellipsized and wrapped labels.

### `wrap`

%TRUE if the label text will wrap if it gets too wide.

### `xalign`

The horizontal alignment of the label text inside its size allocation.

Compare this to [property@Gtk.Widget:halign], which determines how the
labels size allocation is positioned in the space available for the label.

### `yalign`

The vertical alignment of the label text inside its size allocation.

Compare this to [property@Gtk.Widget:valign], which determines how the
labels size allocation is positioned in the space available for the label.

### `copyClipboard`

Gets emitted to copy the selection to the clipboard.

The ::copy-clipboard signal is a [keybinding signal](class.SignalAction.html).

The default binding for this signal is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>.

### `app`

The application.

### `window`

The window.

The accessible role of the given `GtkAccessible` implementation.

The accessible role cannot be changed once set.

### `label(_:)`

The contents of the label.

If the string contains Pango markup (see [func@Pango.parse_markup]),
you will have to set the [property@Gtk.Label:use-markup] property to
%TRUE in order for the label to display the markup attributes. See also
[method@Gtk.Label.set_markup] for a convenience function that sets both
this property and the [property@Gtk.Label:use-markup] property at the
same time.

If the string contains underlines acting as mnemonics, you will have to
set the [property@Gtk.Label:use-underline] property to %TRUE in order
for the label to display them.

### `lines(_:)`

The number of lines to which an ellipsized, wrapping label
should be limited.

This property has no effect if the label is not wrapping or ellipsized.
Set this property to -1 if you don't want to limit the number of lines.
