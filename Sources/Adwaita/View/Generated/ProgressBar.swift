/// `GtkProgressBar` is typically used to display the progress of a long
/// running operation.
/// 
/// It provides a visual clue that processing is underway. `GtkProgressBar`
/// can be used in two different modes: percentage mode and activity mode.
/// 
/// ![An example GtkProgressBar](progressbar.png)
/// 
/// When an application can determine how much work needs to take place
/// (e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its
/// progress, it can use the `GtkProgressBar` in percentage mode and the
/// user sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that
/// has been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call
/// [method@Gtk.ProgressBar.set_fraction] periodically to update the progress bar.
/// 
/// When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work
/// to do, it can use the `GtkProgressBar` in activity mode, which shows
/// activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In
/// this mode, the application is required to call [method@Gtk.ProgressBar.pulse]
/// periodically to update the progress bar.
/// 
/// There is quite a bit of flexibility provided to control the appearance
/// of the `GtkProgressBar`. Functions are provided to control the orientation
/// of the bar, optional text can be displayed along with the bar, and the
/// step size used in activity mode can be set.
/// 
/// # CSS nodes
/// 
/// ```
/// progressbar[.osd]
/// ├── [text]
/// ╰── trough[.empty][.full]
/// ╰── progress[.pulse]
/// ```
/// 
/// `GtkProgressBar` has a main CSS node with name progressbar and subnodes with
/// names text and trough, of which the latter has a subnode named progress. The
/// text subnode is only present if text is shown. The progress subnode has the
/// style class .pulse when in activity mode. It gets the style classes .left,
/// .right, .top or .bottom added when the progress 'touches' the corresponding
/// end of the GtkProgressBar. The .osd class on the progressbar node is for use
/// in overlays like the one Epiphany has for page loading progress.
