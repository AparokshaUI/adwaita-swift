/// `GtkScrolledWindow` is a container that makes its child scrollable.
/// 
/// It does so using either internally added scrollbars or externally
/// associated adjustments, and optionally draws a frame around the child.
/// 
/// Widgets with native scrolling support, i.e. those whose classes implement
/// the [iface@Gtk.Scrollable] interface, are added directly. For other types
/// of widget, the class [class@Gtk.Viewport] acts as an adaptor, giving
/// scrollability to other widgets. [method@Gtk.ScrolledWindow.set_child]
/// intelligently accounts for whether or not the added child is a `GtkScrollable`.
/// If it isn’t, then it wraps the child in a `GtkViewport`. Therefore, you can
/// just add any child widget and not worry about the details.
/// 
/// If [method@Gtk.ScrolledWindow.set_child] has added a `GtkViewport` for you,
/// it will be automatically removed when you unset the child.
/// Unless [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:hscrollbar-policy] and
/// [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:vscrollbar-policy] are %GTK_POLICY_NEVER or
/// %GTK_POLICY_EXTERNAL, `GtkScrolledWindow` adds internal `GtkScrollbar` widgets
/// around its child. The scroll position of the child, and if applicable the
/// scrollbars, is controlled by the [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:hadjustment]
/// and [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:vadjustment] that are associated with the
/// `GtkScrolledWindow`. See the docs on [class@Gtk.Scrollbar] for the details,
/// but note that the “step_increment” and “page_increment” fields are only
/// effective if the policy causes scrollbars to be present.
/// 
/// If a `GtkScrolledWindow` doesn’t behave quite as you would like, or
/// doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
/// your own scrolling with `GtkScrollbar` and for example a `GtkGrid`.
/// 
/// # Touch support
/// 
/// `GtkScrolledWindow` has built-in support for touch devices. When a
/// touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
/// expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
/// [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling] property if it is undesired.
/// 
/// `GtkScrolledWindow` also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
/// the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
/// captured with the [signal@Gtk.ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot] signal.
/// 
/// If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlaid as
/// narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
/// scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
/// can be turned off with the [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling]
/// property.
/// 
/// # CSS nodes
/// 
/// `GtkScrolledWindow` has a main CSS node with name scrolledwindow.
/// It gets a .frame style class added when [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:has-frame]
/// is %TRUE.
/// 
/// It uses subnodes with names overshoot and undershoot to draw the overflow
/// and underflow indications. These nodes get the .left, .right, .top or .bottom
/// style class added depending on where the indication is drawn.
/// 
/// `GtkScrolledWindow` also sets the positional style classes (.left, .right,
/// .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay scrolling
/// (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering) on its scrollbars.
/// 
/// If both scrollbars are visible, the area where they meet is drawn
/// with a subnode named junction.
/// 
/// # Accessibility
/// 
/// Until GTK 4.10, `GtkScrolledWindow` used the `GTK_ACCESSIBLE_ROLE_GROUP` role.
/// 
/// Starting from GTK 4.12, `GtkScrolledWindow` uses the `GTK_ACCESSIBLE_ROLE_GENERIC` role.
