/// `GtkFixed` places its child widgets at fixed positions and with fixed sizes.
/// 
/// `GtkFixed` performs no automatic layout management.
/// 
/// For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
/// you from having to learn about the other GTK containers, but it
/// results in broken applications.  With `GtkFixed`, the following
/// things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
/// other display bugs:
/// 
/// - Themes, which may change widget sizes.
/// 
/// - Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
/// change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
/// users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
/// default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.
/// 
/// - Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
/// display of non-English text will use a different font in many
/// cases.
/// 
/// In addition, `GtkFixed` does not pay attention to text direction and
/// thus may produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left
/// languages such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order
/// containers appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to
/// the right of the thing they label when using an RTL language, but it canâ€™t
/// do that with `GtkFixed`. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on
/// the text direction, you would need to manually detect it and adjust child
/// positions accordingly.
/// 
/// Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
/// UI elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This
/// is a long-term maintenance problem for your application.
/// 
/// If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
/// and prefer the simplicity of `GtkFixed`, by all means use the
/// widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.
